# Pattern Library [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dequelabs/pattern-library.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dequelabs/pattern-library)

## Installation

### NPM

```bash
$ npm install deque-pattern-library
```

### Bower

```bash
$ bower install deque-pattern-library
```

## CDN
Thanks to [unpkg](https://unpkg.com), you can link directly to deque pattern library files.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/deque-pattern-library/dist/css/pattern-library.min.css" />
<!-- or -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/deque-pattern-library/dist/css/pattern-library.css" />
```

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deque-pattern-library/dist/js/pattern-library.min.js"></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deque-pattern-library/dist/js/pattern-library.js"></script>
```

## Fonts

### Including font awesome (v4)

The pattern library relies on font awesome meaning including it is **required**.

### CDN

You can include it using a CDN (see [font awesome getting started docs](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/get-started/))

### npm

```sh
$ npm install font-awesome --save
```


### Including Roboto

The patterns look best when the roboto font is available.

#### CDN

You can include it using a CDN, like so:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700">
```

#### npm

install it:
```sh
$ npm install typeface-roboto --save
```

include it (in your entry-point):
```
import 'typeface-roboto';
```

## Usage

Just drop the css and js into your page:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/deque-pattern-library/dist/css/pattern-library.min.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="./node_modules/deque-pattern-library/dist/js/pattern-library.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## What is included?

  * `pattern-library.min.css`

## Getting started

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/pattern-library/wiki)

## Adding new components/composites

All additions must be approved by our UX team so before working on anything, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/dequelabs/pattern-library/issues) including a detailed description on the requested pattern and several use cases for it.

## Development

- `npm install`
- `npm run build` or for development - `npm run dev` which will rebuild when files are changed

__NOTE__: if a new component or composite is added, remember to create a quick [wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/pattern-library/wiki) entry explaining what is absolutely necessary in using this widget.

### Testing
Testing is done using mochify along with the 'chai' assertion library (`assert.isFalse(!!0)`).  The `test/` directory structure matches the `lib/` directory.  This means that if you're testing `lib/components/foo/index.js`, you would create a test in `test/components/foo/index.js`.  See the `test/` directory for examples.  The tests are browserified and transpiled before running in the phantomjs headless browser so you can `require` / `import` stuff and use ES6 syntax in the tests.

```bash
$ npm test
```

or to have a watcher re-run tests every time you add a new test:

```bash
$ npm run test:dev
```

### Debugging
The pattern library uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module. To turn all debugging on, execute: `localStorage.debug = 'dqpl:*'` and refresh the page.  The directory structure of lib is used as the debug naming convention. For example, to specifically debug the "selects" component, execute: `localStorage.debug = 'dqpl:components:selects'`.
